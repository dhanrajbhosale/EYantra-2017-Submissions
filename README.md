- Planter Bot- (Line Follower using Image Processing)
(Sep 2017 - Apr 2018)

In this project, I worked on extensive image processing. Detecting the shapes of polygon and their color was the most basic task. Then I had to work on black line following robot using Raspberry Pi and Pi-cam and had certain tasks to do on a particular image whenever the bot was told to do so.
